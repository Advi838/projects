<p><i>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) was an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to the field of mathematics: </i></p>



<h1 style="color:#5dade2  ;">Birth</b></h1>
<p><i><h3>Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 into a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family in Erode, in present-day Tamil Nadu. His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar, originally from Thanjavur district, worked as a clerk in a sari shop. His mother, Komalatammal, was a housewife and sang at a local temple. They lived in a small traditional home on Sarangapani Sannidhi Street in the town of Kumbakonam. The family home is now a museum.</h3></i></p>


<h1 style="color:#5dade2 ;">Infinite series</b></h1>
<p><i><h3>In 1910, Ramanujan found several rapidly converging infinite series for π. Ramanujan invented a technique for assigning a value to divergent infinite series, known as the Ramanujan summation. The Ramanujan summation states that the sum of all natural numbers, from 1 to infinity, is equal to -1/12.</h3></i></p>




<h1 style="color:#5dade2 ;">Ramnujan's magic square</b></h1>
<p><i><h3>You can create a Ramanujan magic square by adding or subtracting the same number from each cell of a 3x3 magic square.Ramanujan's magic squares use geometry instead of algebra or mathematics. Ramanujan created a birthday magic square using his date of birth, December 22, 1887. In this magic square, the sum of all four rows, four columns, and two diagonals is 139. The numbers in the top row and left column add up to Ramanujan's date of birth. 
A magic square is basically a matrix with the same number of rows and columns. The sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is called the magic constant or magic sum.
